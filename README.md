# hello-voxelmorph

```

each folder contains exploratory scripts for performing registration 
list below from memory, for sake of documentation for later me.

kinda working :

+ simple-elastix : registration using elastix (via itk and sitk wrappers).

+ synthmorph-wrapper : using synthmorph weights for registration.

+ voxelmorph: very messy, attempting to train using sythmorph weights and/or from scratch.

+ synthmorph-from-scratch: messy, attempting to train synthmorph from scratch.
